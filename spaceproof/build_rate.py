"""build_rate.py - Multiplicative Build Rate Model

THE PARADIGM SHIFT (v2.0 - Grok Integration):
    Build rate B = c x A^alpha x P is MULTIPLICATIVE.
    Autonomy and propulsion multiply - they don't compete.
    Under-pivoting (<30%) = existential stall.

KEY INSIGHT: The v1 question was wrong.
    v1: "What's the optimal allocation between propulsion and autonomy?"
    v2: "Wrong question. They multiply, not trade."

At alpha=1.8:
    A=0.40 -> A^1.8 ~ 0.22 to the product
    A=0.25 -> A^1.8 ~ 0.10 to the product
    A=0.00 -> A^1.8 = 0.00 to the product (existential)

The ratio isn't 40/25 = 1.6x. The ratio is 0.22/0.10 = 2.2x.
That's where Grok's "2.5-3.0x" annual multiplier comes from.
