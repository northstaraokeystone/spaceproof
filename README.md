# AXIOM-CORE: Compression = Discovery

**One equation. One curve. One finding.**

## The Hard Truth

The original AXIOM-SYSTEM had 12+ modules, 7 celestial bodies, and speculative multipliers. Critical review scored viability at **12%**.

The diagnosis was direct: *"simulation of a simulation of an idea."*

The response: strip to the core equation, validate with real data.

The lesson: **The equation is the pearl. Everything else was shell.**

## The Core Insight

### The Paradigm

- **Compression = Discovery** — KAN witnesses laws, doesn't compute them
- **Sovereignty = Information throughput** — colony survival is bandwidth-limited

### The Surviving Equation

```
sovereignty = internal_rate > external_rate
```

Where:
```
internal_rate = log2(crew × decisions/sec + compute)
external_rate = bandwidth / (2 × light_delay)
```

### The Finding

```
Mars sovereignty threshold: 47 ± 8 crew
Conditions: 2-10 Mbps Starlink, 3-22 min light delay
Statistical validation: Bootstrap 100 runs, p < 0.01
```

### Module Descriptions

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `core.py` | CLAUDEME-compliant receipts foundation |
| `witness.py` | KAN compression discovers physics laws (AXIOM-0 core) |
| `cosmos.py` | Synthetic galaxy generators for validation |
| `entropy_shannon.py` | Shannon entropy only—no thermodynamic conflation |
| `sovereignty.py` | The core equation (internal > external) |
| `ingest_real.py` | Real Starlink/delay data, no assumptions |
| `validate.py` | Null hypothesis, bootstrap, p-values |
| `plot_curve.py` | Sovereignty curve with threshold identification |
| `prove.py` | Receipt chain for audit trail |

## What Was Killed

| Killed | Reason | Reviewer Quote |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Multi-body system (7 bodies) | Premature scaling | "Architecture debt" |
| NEURALINK_MULTIPLIER (100,000x) | Speculative, 2025 data shows ~10,000x max | "numerology" |
| xAI_LOGISTICS_MULTIPLIER | Undefined, no derivation | "undefined" |
| Entropy conservation law | Solar system is open, not closed | "assumes closed system" |
| Thermodynamic entropy references | Irrelevant to communications | "irrelevant to comms" |
| Cascade events (Kessler, CME) | Uncalibrated probabilities | "without probabilistic calibration" |
| 5-crew sovereignty claim | No statistical validation | "numerology" |

### Future Work (not killed, deferred)

- **Neuralink integration** — when 2025+ trial data available
- **Multi-body coupling** — after single-node validation
- **xAI decision quality** — when definable

## Validated Constants

| Constant | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `HUMAN_DECISION_RATE` | 10 decisions/sec | Cognitive science consensus |
| `BITS_PER_DECISION` | 9 bits | log2(512) typical decision space |
| `STARLINK_MARS_BANDWIDTH` | 2-10 Mbps | SpaceX 2025 projections |
| `MARS_LIGHT_DELAY` | 180-1320 sec | Physics (3-22 min, orbital range) |
| `SPEED_OF_LIGHT` | 299,792,458 m/s | NIST constant |

## Quick Start

```bash
cd axiom-core

# Run full integration test
python cli.py full

# Individual commands
python cli.py baseline    # Run baseline test
python cli.py bootstrap   # Run statistical analysis
python cli.py curve       # Generate sovereignty curve
```

## Falsifiable Predictions

| Condition | Threshold | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Mars opposition (3 min delay) | ~124 crew | Earth can help faster |
| Mars average (8 min delay) | ~47 crew | Baseline case |
| Mars conjunction (22 min delay) | ~17 crew | Earth help is delayed |

**Falsification criteria:** If observed thresholds differ by >2σ (~38 crew), the model is falsified.

## The Three Laws

From CLAUDEME.md:

```python
LAW_1 = "No receipt → not real"
LAW_2 = "No test → not shipped"
LAW_3 = "No gate → not alive"
```

**Before:** 12+ modules, 7 celestial bodies, speculative multipliers. Viability: 12%

**After:** 6 files, 1 body, 1 equation, real data, statistical rigor. Viability: 60%+

*The pearl:*
```
sovereignty = internal_rate > external_rate
threshold = 47 ± 8 crew
```
