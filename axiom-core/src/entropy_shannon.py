"""entropy_shannon.py - Shannon H ONLY. No thermodynamic metaphors.

THE PEARL: Entropy is information. Period.

This module locks entropy to Shannon's definition:
  H = -sum(p_i * log2(p_i))

For our sovereignty equation, we measure DECISION RATES:
  - internal_rate: decisions/sec available locally (crew + compute)
  - external_rate: decisions/sec available from Earth (bandwidth-limited)

The key insight: Earth can only help at round-trip limited rate.
Each decision query/response cycle requires BITS_PER_DECISION bits.

NO speculative multipliers. NO Neuralink assumptions. NO xAI logistics.
Just the math.
